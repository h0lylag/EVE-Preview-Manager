# EVE Preview Manager

EVE Preview Manager — Yet another EVE-O-Preview clone for Linux, written in Rust. A reimplementation of my older [EVE-L_Preview](https://github.com/h0lylag/EVE-L_Preview). Inspired by [EVE-O-Preview](https://github.com/Proopai/eve-o-preview) and [EVE-X-Preview](https://github.com/g0nzo83/EVE-X-Preview), [Nicotine](https://github.com/isomerc/nicotine), and [eve-l-preview](https://github.com/ilveth/eve-l-preview).

## Status

This is still under active development and should be working. But keep in mind it's primarily designed around my own workflow and environment.

## Screenshots
Coming soon
